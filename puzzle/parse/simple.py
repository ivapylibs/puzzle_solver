# @class    puzzle.parser.simple
#
# @brief    A simple parsing engine for recovering puzzle pieces from a
#           layer mask and an image. It's only job is to recover said
#           information from an image. No attempt is made to do anything
#           else, such as associate over time or anything like that.
#           For flexibility, this class is a perceiver. There will be
#           many ways to instantiate a simple parser.
