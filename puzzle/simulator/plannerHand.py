# @class    puzzle.simulator.plannerHand
#
# @brief    The planner for producing the action sequence to solve the puzzle.
#           Hand needs to have more interpretations for the action. Mainly for simulation.
#           It is only useful for the synthetic case.
# @note     Yunzhi: more like a wrapper of solver & manager in the test script.
