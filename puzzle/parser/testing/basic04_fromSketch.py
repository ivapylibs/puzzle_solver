# @brief    Code to test out the simple image detector for a fairly
#           contrived scenario: threshold a grayscale image.
#
# Upgrades earlier test scripts to use a depth image plus upper and lower
# depth limits to establish a detection depth zone. The "depth image" here
# is simply fictitious data placed into an array (same as fake data in
# earlier test scripts).
