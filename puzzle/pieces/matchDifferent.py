#
# @brief    Sub-classes of this derived class branch use similarity
#           scores for determining wheter two puzzle pieces match.
#
# Difference scores are interpreted as smaller being more likely to be a
# match and bigger being less likely to be a match. There will usually
# be lower and upper limits for the difference score.
