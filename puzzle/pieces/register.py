#
# @brief    Class for registering puzzle pieces in support of puzzle solving after
#           puzzle piece association.  The base-type class and most of its member
#           functions will do nothing. They require overloading.  
#
# Sub-classes of this derived class branch will implement custom registration strategies
# under the presumption that some matching scheme has successfully associated puzzle
# pieces across two boards.  The registration approach can be bound to the feature
# description strategy or it could be independent of it.  That's up to the class to
# establish, along with the keypoint descriptor scheme.
#
# Registration is only needed if the placement of the puzzle piece requires correct
# orientations. If not, then puzzle piece "centers" should be enough.
