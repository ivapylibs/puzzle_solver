# ========================= puzzle.piece.matcher =========================
#
# @brief    Derived class from puzzle piece template that adds
#           operations for comparing puzzle pieces and performing puzzle
#           solving.  This class is a base-type class and most of the
#           member functions will do nothing and require overloading.
#           The ones that don't should be for some generic
#           functionality.
